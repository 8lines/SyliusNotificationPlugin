## Custom Notification Channel Form Type
To create a custom Notification Channel Form Type, you need to create a class that extends `AbstractType`.

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace ...;

use Symfony\Component\Form\AbstractType;
use Symfony\Component\Form\FormBuilderInterface;

class CustomNotificationChannelFormType extends AbstractType
{
    public function buildForm(FormBuilderInterface $builder, array $options): void
    {
        parent::buildForm($builder, $options); // TODO: Change the autogenerated stub
    }
}
```

Adding fields to this form type is the same as adding fields to any other form type. 
But there are one extra rule that you need to follow:
you should use predefined EventSubscribers to add fields to this form type.

## Predefined Event Subscribers
Plugin offers a few predefined EventSubscribers that you can use to add fields to the form type.

### AddContentFormSubscriber
This subscriber is used to add a content field to the form type.
It allows you to add a subject and a message to the notification.

```php
$builder
    ->addEventSubscriber(new AddContentFormSubscriber(
        subject: true,
        message: true,
    ))
;
```

As you can see, you can specify if the subject and the message fields should be added to the configuration.

You can also override the required option for each field:

```php
$builder
    ->addEventSubscriber(new AddContentFormSubscriber(
        subject: true,
        message: true,
        options: [
            'subject_required' => false,
            'message_required' => false,
        ],
    ))
;
```

### AddRecipientsFormSubscriber
This subscriber is used to add a recipient fields to the form type.

```php
$builder
    ->addEventSubscriber(new AddRecipientsFormSubscriber())
;
```

It doesn't have any additional options.

### AddCustomConfigurationFormSubscriber
It allows you to add fully custom configuration fields to the form type.
Only thing you need to do is to create additional form type and pass it to the subscriber.
You can put there any fields you want.

```php
$builder
    ->addEventSubscriber(new AddCustomConfigurationFormSubscriber(
        type: CustomNotificationChannelCustomConfigurationType::class,
        options: [],
    ))
;
```

Then to access this custom configuration in the Notification Channel, you can use the `getConfiguration` method of `NotificationContext`.

```php
public function send(
    ?NotificationRecipient $recipient,
    NotificationBody $body,
    NotificationContext $context,
): void {
    $configuration = $context->getConfiguration();
    
    $configuration->hasCustomValue(/* ... */);
    $configuration->getCustomValue(/* ... */);
}
```
